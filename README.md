Ignition Common, a component of [Ignition
Robotics](https://ignitionrobotics.org), provides a set of libraries that
cover many different use cases. An audio-visual library supports
processing audio and video files, a graphics library can load a variety 3D
mesh file formats into a generic in-memory representation, and the core
library of Ignition Common contains functionality that spans Base64
encoding/decoding to thread pools.

# Features

Some of the many capabilities contained in Ignition Common are:

* **AV**: FFMpeg based audio decoder, and video encoder and decoder.
* **Core**: Base64 encoding and decoding, battery model, console logging,
  cross-platform filesystem interface, URI processing, and a thread pool.
* **Events**: Mouse and keyboard events, and a high-performance signal and
callback system.
* **Graphics**: Collada, SVG, STL, OBJ, and DEM loaders. In-memory mesh,
  image, and material representations. Animation processing and BVH loader.
* **Profiler**: A common profiler abstraction that can be used to measure and
  visualize run time of various pieces of ignition robotics software.
