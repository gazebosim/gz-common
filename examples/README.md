# Examples

These examples demonstrate various Ignition Common features.

## Build

After installing Ignition Common, from source or from binaries, build with:

```
git clone https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-common/
cd ign-common/examples
mkdir build
cd build

## Run

One execuable is created inside the `build` folder for each example.

You can run each executable from the build folder with `./executablename`. For example:

`./events_example`
