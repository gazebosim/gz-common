\page profiler Profiler

## Overview

This tutorial describes how to get started using the Ignition Common profiler
to measure and visualize run-time performance of your software.

The `ignition::common::Profiler` provides a common interface that can allow for
multiple underlying profiler implementations. Currently, the only available
implementation is [Remotery](https://github.com/Celtoys/Remotery).

The goal of the profiler is to provide introspection and analysis when enabled
at compile time, but to introduce no overhead when it is disabled at compile-time.

To control if the profiler is enabled, set the `IGN_PROFILER_ENABLE` flag using
cmake on the targets or sources that you are interested in (described below).

## Enabling the Profiler

In order to use the profiler, inspection points must be added to the source code,
and the application or library must be linked to the `ignition-common::profiler`
component.

To start, download the [profiler.cc](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-common/raw/master/examples/profiler.cc) example.

The relevant corresponding C++ would be as follows:

```{.cpp}
// Add the profiler header
#include <ignition/common/Profiler.hh>

...

void thread(const char *_thread_name)
{
  // Sets the name of the thread to appear in the UI
  IGN_PROFILE_THREAD_NAME(_thread_name);
  while (running)
  {
    // Add a profiling point to this scope.
    IGN_PROFILE("Loop");
    // Execute some arbitrary tasks
    for (size_t ii = 0; ii < 10; ++ii)
    {
      task1();
    }
    task2();
    task3();
  }
}
```

Update your CMakeLists.txt to the following. Note that the profiler must be
enabled at compile time in order to function.

```{.cpp}
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8 FATAL_ERROR)

# Find the ignition-common library
find_package(ignition-common3 QUIET REQUIRED COMPONENTS profiler)

add_executable(profiler_example profiler.cc)
target_link_libraries(profiler_example ignition-common3::profiler)
# Enable the profiler for the example
target_compile_definitions(profiler_example PUBLIC "IGN_PROFILER_ENABLE=1")
```

Run `cmake` and build the example

```{.sh}
cd build
cmake ..
make profiler_example
```

Then execute the example and the profiler visualization:

From terminal 1:

```{.sh}
./profiler_example
```

From terminal 2, open the visualizer using one of the following commands

```{.sh}
# Use a launcher script (Linux and macOS)
ign_remotery_vis

# Use the source path (Linux)
# Substitute the path to your ign-common source checkout
xdg-open $SOURCE_DIR/ign-common/profiler/src/Remotery/vis/index.html

# Use the installation path (Linux)
# This may vary depending on where you have choosen to install
xdg-open /usr/share/ignition/ignition-common3/profiler_vis/index.html

# Use the installation path (macOS)
open /usr/share/ignition/ignition-common3/profiler_vis/index.html
```

If you are successful, you should see the profiler output in a browser.

## Using the Profiler

The profiler is used through a series of macros.

The two primary ways of profiling a section of code are to either use
a matched pair of `IGN_PROFILE_BEGIN` and `IGN_PROFILE_END` macros, or to use
a single RAII-style macro `IGN_PROFILE`. The RAII style will stop measuring
once the scope that the macro was invoked in is left.

Using begin/end:

```{.cpp}
  // An example of using start/stop profiling.
  IGN_PROFILE_BEGIN("a");
  std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(2));
  IGN_PROFILE_END();
```

Using RAII-style:

```{.cpp}
  {
    // An example of using scope-based profiling.
    IGN_PROFILE("a");
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(2));
  }
```

Additionally, each thread can be given a name for easy reference in the UI:

```{.cpp}
  IGN_PROFILE_THREAD_NAME("main");
  IGN_PROFILE_THREAD_NAME("physics");
  IGN_PROFILE_THREAD_NAME("gui");
```

## Configuring the Profiler

Specific profiler implementations may have further configuration options available.

### Configuring Remotery

Remotery can additionally be configured via environment variables. Most users
should not need to change these for their applications.

 * `RMT_PORT`: Port to listen for incoming connections on.
 * `RMT_QUEUE_SIZE`: Size of the internal message queues
 * `RMT_MSGS_PER_UPDATE`: Upper limit on messages consumed per loop
 * `RMT_SLEEP_BETWEEN_UPDATES`: Controls profile server update rate.

These directly set the corresponding parameters in the `rmtSettings` structure.
